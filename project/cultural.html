        <p>We need packaging and innovation. The first point is to be able to tell stories. The local tourism resources are weak, because of the lack of IP, the cultural background and the uniqueness of the story are not enough to infect tourists. Then the first thing to think about is to tell stories to the scenic spot and pack the cultural atmosphere. I think it is to extend the local culture and consider what kind of stories tourists want to hear in the context of history. Local specialties, combined with cultural customs, we can create more merchandise sales.like, It was New Year's Day, and we immediately started a New Year's Day event, planning a public account tweet: New Year's Wishes, the most beautiful river bank ancient town New Year's Day River Lantern Prayer Festival to receive benefits. We can prepared 10,000 river lanterns, and let all channels, resources, government platforms, and businesses collect likes and repost them, and receive river lanterns after reposting.</p>
