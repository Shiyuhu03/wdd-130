The Spring Festival is the day when fireworks are set off. Our first selling point is that this is the river bank where fireworks can be set off all year round. After confirming the theme of the fireworks display, we need to make in-depth marketing plans, such as: Japan is too far to watch the fireworks festival, so bring your family to the Mokdong Fireworks Conference.

You can even add our traditional firecracker culture and the legend of the Nian Beast to make a parent-child study program. Travel product line. </p>
